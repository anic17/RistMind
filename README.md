# RistMind
### A chatbot made entirely in batch.  

While maybe not actually an AI, it can get smarter by talking to it more and explaining concepts. For now, it doesn't have NLP so the responses are very similar.

It can be "trained" (or at least have expanded knowledge) creating a file called `trained.ai` and adding definitions.

Uses module [Slang2english](https://github.com/anic17/slang2english) to understand better what user says. This module is required to use RistMind.

It can link actions, define terms, do basic math calculations, tell jokes...

It's coded 100% in batch, to demonstrate the power of that scripting language.
