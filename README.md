# RistMind
### A chatbot made entirely in batch.  
It can be "trained" (or at least have expanded knowledge) creating a file called `trained.ai` and adding definitions.

Uses module [Slang2english](https://github.com/anic17/slang2english) to understand better what user says.

It can link actions, define terms, do basic math calculations, tell jokes...

It's coded 100% in batch, to demonstrate the power of that scripting language.
